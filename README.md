# Auto-sending-keylogger
A Keylogger that can email the log every 24 hours

This is a basic but great script to automate tasks. You can copy it and make modifications to it as you prefer.

Make sure to use your own credentials and local path. Also, make sure to use the corresponding smtp details for your email client.
